    <!-- 1st way (Worst and 4th way)-->
    <!-- 1. 1st way to load link js file <script src="102.js"></script>//This is the wrong way of linking a Js file
    // If one links the js file this way then the browser when parsing the js file won't get the 
    // below html elements used in the js file so the browser will throw error
    -->

    <!-- 3rd Way (Bad or 3rd best way)-->
    <!-- <script src="./102.js" async></script> This is the 3rd way to link the Js file- -->
    <!-- the async word makes the process asycn // Here the 2 steps will happen asyncally
    //1. Parsing of the entire html file even after reaching the js file will continue along with the full loading of the Js file will happen simultaneously -->
    <!-- But if the js file will be completely loaded and the parsing of the html file is
    not completed the browser will stop pasing the other incomplete html file and since the 
    loading of the js file is complete will execute it first . Now this may cause trouble as 
    the loaded js file may include some html elements will is yet not parsed by the browser -->

    <!-- 4th Way(Best Way) -->
    <script src="./112.js" defer></script><!-- note: always write defer in the script tag others the browser may have troble when executing the script // Chances are 80%-->
    <!-- Advanatge and better than all the other way b/c 
    //Parsing and loading happen simultaneously.
    This way increases the website performance 
    It saves time. Time effecient way-->

    <!-- This is the updated and improved verson of the 3rd async way
    In the sync way when the js file loading process way complete the browser was
    stopping the parse of the remaining html file .But in defer way even when the 
    loading of the js file is complete the browser won't execute the js file and stop 
    parsing the html file will not execute the js file even after it is loading.
    It will finish parsing the entire html file (even the remaining part) and 
    when the parsing is complete then and only then will execute the already loaded and waitied Js file -->
