"use strict"; //--> add additional restiction to the js code
console.log(`Hello Universe`);

//console

//Backticks and string literal -> string interpolation or variable interpolation (substitution or replacement)

//Variables-> Variables names are case sensitive
// var -> once declared then next time one can re-assign or re-declare and use the same variable
// No need to write var when re-assign the same variable again and again tho' one can write var when re-assigning , error is not thrown
// # When declaring variable var if not written is also fine. 
//# Variables can be executed without writting var

//  firstName= "dib";// --> will throw error if var not wriiten before name bc of use strict
var firstName ="dib"
console.log(firstName);

//# "use strict"; --> This tag helps Js developers to add additional restriction in our Js code
//# The additional restriction is neccessary as we have seen in our variable declaration notes then variables 
//-> can be declared without writing var defire the variable_name .That can be cause developers great trouble
//-> the fact that JavaScript provides enormous freedom in the code to the developers
