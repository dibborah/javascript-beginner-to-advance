// Declare variables using let not var

// let firstName = "dib";
// console.log(firstName);

// var vs let


// # In case of var variables can be re-assigned or declared 
// var firstName = "dib";
// var firstName = "niki"
// console.log(firstName);

// # In case of var variables cannot be re-assigned or re-declared if let is wrote twice 
// let firstName = "dib";
// let firstName = "niki"
// console.log(firstName);

//# Vriable can be re-assigned of re-declared after writting let if before the re-assigned variable let keyword is not  written
// let firstName = "dib";
//  firstName = "niki"
// console.log(firstName);


// let varible can never be declared more than once but can be re-assigned more than once if the let keyword is not written more than once


//Block scoping vs function scoping will learn later in the video
